Hello everyone! We have started working on creating a Landing Page. To make it as clear and useful as possible, it’s important to first put our ideas and goals “on paper.” I gathered the main thoughts into a small text and would like to share it with you. I’d really appreciate your feedback — it’s important to understand if we’re moving in the right direction.


At the moment, Telegram lacks a full-fledged music functionality. Users can upload files and forward messages, but musicians’ rights are not respected, and listening to music remains extremely inconvenient. Our primary goal is to implement a proper music system inside Telegram.

I am an artist myself and also the target audience of this project. For me, it’s important to have a professionally designed music page and profile within Telegram.

At the initial stage, we are focusing on quality musicians. Our goal is not millions of tracks, but rather a relatively small group of artists that we can showcase from different angles. In the era of AI, the musician of the future should be not only a performer but also partly an actor and manager, capable of building a fan community around themselves. We want to support musicians in this by providing attention, tools, and unexpected interaction mechanics that other services don’t offer.

At the same time, getting in won’t be easy. We evaluate not only the musical level of candidates but also their personal approach: activity on social media, engagement with their audience, quality of visual content. We care about real creativity, not AI generation.

Most projects in the music space fall into two categories: “Spotify killers” or Patreon alternatives, often implemented through NFT marketplaces. The first group fails because monetization requires massive paid subscriptions, which is impossible without artists — a vicious circle. The second group offers nothing new, often presenting the technology (NFT) as a benefit. However, NFT is just a tool, not the point. Without context, it’s just a forgotten hype. We aim to avoid both categories.

Our approach: first, bring music to Telegram and prove that it’s convenient to listen there. After that, we’ll introduce new forms of interaction between artist and listener. Innovation is the best way forward when the industry is stuck.

The project will be integrated with the TON blockchain. Don’t worry — we’re tired of random web3 music projects ourselves. We don’t even tie the project’s name directly to music to avoid the negative connotation of recent years.

1. The blockchain will store full information on plays, subscriptions, and other data, ensuring transparency and openness. Artists will be able to track royalty flows, and third-party analysts can build verification tools.  
2. NFTs will be used “under the hood” of mechanics, with clear context and purpose. This isn’t a marketplace, but a tool to enrich the experience and interactions.  
3. Payments will be made via Stars, which can be purchased with TON. We’ll also offer TON as one way to receive royalties. It’s convenient, transparent, and independent of political factors.  

We plan direct interaction with musicians. The database architecture and API are built to international standards for possible future integration, but the priority remains personal “chemistry” with artists, solving their problems quickly, and supporting creativity. We want to be their IT superpower, minimizing middlemen for whom transparency and convenience have long ceased to be a priority.

Telegram gives the project unique opportunities: notifications, messages, automation, gifts, Stars, chats. Our goal is to become part of the ecosystem, following Telegram’s tech and design guidelines.


### Monetization:

One day we’ll get to subscription models (hopefully as part of Telegram Premium). Then royalties will be distributed through the classic scheme, with at least one key difference: the user’s subscription fee will be split among the artists they actually listened to. This removes fraud issues and makes royalties fair.

But until we get there, we propose the following:

#### 1. Musician promotion
From personal experience: if a musician at the start tries to sell every single play — it’s a dead-end path. One free listen can bring a true fan who will support you for years.  

I once came up with the “flea-dog” principle: I’m the “flea,” and the “dog” is any project that needs music. I found such projects early on and gave them tracks for free. They grew — and with them, my audience grew. Often this returned through license sales, sheet music, or new streaming listeners.  

Now we want to become that “dog” for musicians. And Telegram is perfect: a huge audience and a chance to be heard without competing with millions of AI tracks and industry “giants” that already dominate the market.  

It’s important to note that profile information and links to external platforms (Spotify, Yandex.Music) are not restricted — if we bring listeners to a musician, that’s only a plus.  

#### 2. Monetization through “JIBBITZ”
Inspired by Crocs and their Jibbitz charms, we named our approach to extra monetization the same way. The idea is simple: users will be able to buy services and customizations for Bilbo with Stars. Most of this revenue will go to musicians.  

Example: remember Winamp and its plugins? We’ll allow anyone to create interactive plugins for the player, which will be sold through our developer studio. Authors get Stars, users get new fun features, and artists earn extra income. And that’s just one of many possible cases.  

#### 3. Licensing
We plan to let users purchase licenses for music — from YouTube videos to feature films. If a listener likes a track, they can immediately license it, or, with the artist’s permission, download it for free for non-commercial use. I plan to enable this option for my own music.


### Studio for musicians
We’re building a studio that’s convenient for both artists and musicians. The first demos showed high interest from the industry — they see real value in it. But this is only part of Bilbo. Once we form a team of curators and editors, they’ll become the internal client, and we’ll keep improving the product while getting direct feedback from musicians. This is crucial. In the future, distribution may be launched, though it’s not a priority, but the architecture is ready.


### Artificial Intelligence
We are firmly against AI music and “algorithmic authors,” but we use AI as a tool. It helps automate routine, analyze data, improve search and recommendations. A user will be able to, for example, write in Telegram: “Find me 1.5 hours of calm acoustic guitar music for the evening” — and the system will provide results. Or maybe they’ll just drop a Nicolas Cage meme in the chat — no problem.  


### Lossless and the AROUND format
We support lossless from the start. In addition, we’re developing a new format called AROUND. Based on our experience with binaural sound, we’re creating a technology that will let listeners feel “on stage” with the artists. Each listening will be unique.


### AURA
When you buy coffee, you’re not just buying a drink. You’re buying 10–15 minutes of personal time and space: the atmosphere, a comfortable chair, the warmth of the cup in your hands. It’s an experience, not just a product.  

Music is the same. Every day countless tracks appear, but what stays with us is not the sound itself — it’s the context. Remember the first chords of *Light of the Seven* by Ramin Djawadi. These notes appeared in thousands of works, but paired with the empty streets of the Red Keep and Cersei’s measured walk, they gained power and gave goosebumps.  

We want to give artists a tool to create such context, so their music is not just background but a full-fledged experience. You haven’t seen anything like this before.  


### HEXA
Our experience with maps and geolocation inspired us to merge music and space. Over two years we gathered dozens of hypotheses and mechanics we plan to test. This is truly an unusual approach.


### ROYALTY
We are exploring a model where royalties become similar to shares: they can be bought, sold, or generate income. This is more transparent and profitable than traditional crowdfunding. There are attempts on the market, but we haven’t seen user-friendly and reliable solutions yet. It’s not our top priority, but it’s an important direction we’ll definitely explore.


### KANBY
We are developing a self-organization tool for musicians, based on Kanban principles. This will allow artists to create “tickets” — for example, “Write sheet music for *Je Vois La Vie*.” Subscribers will be able to track progress, receive updates, and even support the process through donations or buying results. This tool will increase transparency and discipline, and create a new format of audience interaction.


### ROOMY
We’ve already tested shared music listening in synchronous “rooms.” This allows sharing a moment even at a distance — whether it’s a party without loud music or teamwork in a distributed group.


### Donations
The donation system will be simple and native: transfers via Stars directly to artists. Moreover, even reacting to a music post in Telegram with Stars will automatically become a donation.


### Playlists
We’ll have editorial, user, and algorithmic playlists. Playlists can be public or private, with flexible access (like Google Docs). We’ll implement playlist pitching through Stars — without complicated external tools. In the future, playlist owners will be able to receive a share of royalties: not from the artist’s share, but from ours. This will encourage high-quality selections.


### Funding
Currently, the project is developed and financed by two people — Tyufyakin Konstantin and Ivanov Gleb. We’ve been lucky to be both musicians and developers. Lucky to go through dozens of failures, lucky to work with different distributors and study many projects. Lucky we didn’t start this story too early. In short, lucky here, lucky there — so now we’re ready to make mistakes and bump our heads again.  

In the future, we don’t rule out seeking funding, primarily to delegate part of the tasks. But what’s much more important to us is that partners share our vision and believe in the project as much as we do. Money is a tool, but drive and shared philosophy are the foundation. If this resonates with you — reach out, we’d be glad to talk.
