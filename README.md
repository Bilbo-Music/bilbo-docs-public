# What is Bilbo?

Bilbo is an innovative music streaming platform designed to connect emerging artists with their target audiences. Our mission is to bring high-quality, human-created music into the Telegram ecosystem, providing a unique space for both listeners and artists. We believe in the power of genuine creativity and stand firmly against the use of AI-generated music, ensuring that our platform is a space for authentic human expression.

## Who is Bilbo for?

Bilbo is tailored for music lovers eager to discover new talent, aspiring artists looking for a platform to share their work, and curators dedicated to promoting quality music. We prioritize the artistry and hard work of musicians, making it clear that while AI can assist in the creative process, fully AI-generated tracks will never be featured on our platform.

## Whatâ€™s included in the MVP?

Our Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will bring music directly into Telegram through a user-friendly mini-app. Key features will include:

- Effortless music listening and playlist management.
- The ability to favorite tracks, artists, and playlists.
- Artist profiles with music previews, social media links, and more.
- A dedicated space for artists to upload their tracks and manage their profiles.

## Looking Ahead to Web3

While we are focused on building a robust product, we recognize the potential of Web3 technologies. In the future, Bilbo will explore:

- Transparent royalty distribution processes.
- Accessible analytics for all users.
- Direct payments to artists, reducing losses in the traditional distribution chain.
- Implementing royalties for playlist curators and content creators, ensuring everyone benefits from the music ecosystem.
- Exploring NFT integration for special projects to enhance user engagement and artist recognition.

Join us on this exciting journey as we elevate the music experience in Telegram, supporting artists and connecting them with listeners like never before! Stay tuned for updates and get ready to discover your next favorite track on Bilbo!
