There are multiple approaches to storing artist data. Many streaming services automatically create artist pages whenever convenient. For example, when uploading a track via a distributor that features “Petr Petrov,” a separate full artist page for “Petr Petrov” is often created automatically.

The issue is magnified by algorithmic matching of releases to artists using a “best match” principle. If metadata includes an identical full name, the release may appear on that artist’s page and their fans may receive notifications about participation in a release the artist never authorized. This creates substantial risks — reputational, legal, and operational — and opens the door to various types of abuse.

Even major platforms such as Spotify face significant operational costs from this: they must maintain large support teams to manually triage and resolve incoming disputes. A growing trend is the generation of music “in the name of” known artists and uploading it under their identities. While established artists can often have such releases removed relatively quickly, thousands of independent artists suffer real financial and brand damage.

## What we do differently

- **Mandatory artist verification.** Each artist profile is created only through controlled flows and must be verified by the owner. This prevents uncontrolled creation of fake profiles.
- **Confirmed participation status.** Contributors have an explicit participation status — *Confirmed*. No one can be added as a contributor and publish material under an artist’s name without their confirmation.
- **Unregistered artist name for external mentions.** When a track involves an artist not yet present in our database, we store the name as a plain text tag — *unregistered artist name*. This is a display-only mention and does not participate in search, filters, or notifications.
- **Editing and safe replacement.** Contributors can be edited at any time, including after publication. When the referenced artist later registers on the platform, the unregistered name can be safely and easily replaced with the verified profile.
- **Notification and matching mechanics.** Once an artist registers, we can notify other users who previously used the same unregistered name and provide workflows to confirm or link the collaboration.

At this stage our priority is to maintain control and quality while minimizing legal and operational risk. We are not aiming for an “open garbage dump” model where rights are routinely violated; we want a secure, well-governed environment for artists and rights holders.
