# What to Expect from MVP Studio

In October, we plan to launch the first stage of the project — MVP Studio. Below is a brief overview of its functionality and objectives to ensure a shared understanding.

## Introduction

Bilbo is a music streaming service within Telegram. The goal of the MVP is to demonstrate that listening to music in the messenger can be not only convenient but also unique, leveraging the platform’s specific features.

The first step is launching a website with introductory information and a submission form for artists.

**Important:** Submission will be selective, prioritizing high-quality music and genuine artistry. AI-generated tracks and stock compositions will not be accepted. Each submission will be manually reviewed, with no intermediaries between Bilbo and the artist. This approach reduces supply while increasing content value. Post-MVP, it will become clear how much potential artists can unlock when supported properly.

## Target Audience of Studio

**Curator and Editor Team**  
An independent team will manage tracks, releases, genres, categories, and storefronts. The role distribution system ensures transparency and security. This team will act as an internal client, driving new features and improvements. Formation is planned for Q1 2026.

**Artists**  
For artists, Studio provides tools for managing tracks, releases, licenses, collaborations, and submissions. Functionally, it is similar to Spotify for Artists, integrated within Bilbo.

## Core MVP Studio Functionality

### Tracks
- Each track is a standalone entity and can exist without a release.  
- Fields and formats follow industry standards for future integration with other services.  
- Snippets (15–30 seconds) allow quick previewing and use in projects.  
- Support for Content ID, PRO, and free downloads enables promotion on YouTube, TikTok, Reeks, Shazam, and streaming platforms, including monetization via Content ID.  
- Advanced metadata can be added; accurate information supports promotion, while spam is detrimental. Artists control track promotion by providing correct information.  
- Each track has a rating, partially determined by curators, visible to artists to guide their promotional efforts.

### Releases
- Standard release fields are preserved.  
- Release type is automatically determined:  
  - **Album** — 7+ tracks  
  - **EP** — 4–6 tracks  
  - **Single** — 1–3 tracks  
- When publishing a release, tracks without a release date or cover inherit these attributes automatically.  
- Additional mechanics: custom covers for tracks in a release and serial album release (one track at a time).

### Licenses
- Option for free track download (if permitted by the artist).  
- Link to license purchase via integration with icons8 and LSM.

### Track and Release Participation
- All participants can be credited: authors, producers, mastering engineers, etc.  
- Each participant’s contribution is displayed on their profile, supporting both artist and team promotion.  
- Participation confirmation prevents unauthorized inclusion of tracks or fake content.

### Playlists
- MVP includes curator playlists. Functionality will expand in the future.

## User Experience
- Interface supports 11 languages, including RTL.  
- Follows Telegram guidelines.  
- Transparent and user-friendly design, minimizing fatigue and ensuring clarity for artists and curators.

User feedback will be continuously collected to improve Studio.

In summary, MVP Studio is a tool for efficient track, release, and promotion management, ensuring transparency, security, and control for both artists and curators.
